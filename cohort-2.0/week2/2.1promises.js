/*Promises:
  just a syntactical sugar
  just more readable way to write async functions
//can write js w/o them, just by using callbacks

//A promise in JavaScript is an object that represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.
//It is used for handling asynchronous operations, such as making API calls or reading files, in a more organized and readable way.
